# Web Based Particle Device Setup

This project is intended to provide a web based setup for [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) IoT devices.

**This project is currently under work and not ready for use. Check back for periodic updates.**

This project allows someone to configure a new or existing Particle device using their web browser. Particle provides great example applications for iOS and Android development, but not currently for a web based setup. I needed to have a web based option to use, so decided to start one up. The user interface is modeled off of Particle's own setup application so should feel similar. It's built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap).

The goal for this application will be a way to easily setup and conifgure developer or personal devices, and people can add their own custom settings (e.g. product specific paramaters) for their various products.

Details for getting started are located below.

## Getting Set Up

After downloading or cloning, to get started run:
`npm install`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
